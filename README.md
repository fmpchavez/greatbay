In class assignment creating an 'ebay like' node app

## First things First
	I forgot to create the remote repo before actually starting this assignment so here's the instructions to convert a local repo to a remote one:

1. Go to local directory
   Run `git init`
2. Add files to local repo
   `git add .`
3. Commit files
   `git commit -m "first commit"
4. Grab the URL from the remote repo on GitHub
   `git remote add origin [remote repo URL]`
   `git remote -v`
